Fractional Cascading on Binary Tree

File 1: fractional_cascading.py
This is the file that implements a basic fractional cascading. 
Run this program by typing in command line the following:
* python -u fractional_cascading.py
Then it will show you the current 2d arrays and prompt you to enter a value you want to search in the 2d arrays
The cascaded structure is both printed and included in the diagram FC_demonstration.png

File 2: binary_tree_FC.py
This is the file that implements fractional cascading on binary tree data structure. 
Run this program by typing in command line the following:
* python -u fractional_cascading.py 
Each node will be named by its index in preorder traversal
The tree structure is shown in the diagram bt_fc_demo.png
