Fractional Cascading on Binary Tree

File 1: fractional_cascading.py
This is the file that implements a basic fractional cascading. 
Run this program by typing in command line the following:
* python -u fractional_cascading.py
And it will show you the current 2d arrays and fractionally cascaded structure, then prompt you to enter a value you want to search in the 2d arrays
Printed results are in the PDF name "Fractional Cascading Basic"

File 2: binary_tree_FC.py
This is the file that implements fractional cascading on binary tree data structure. 
Run this program by typing in command line the following:
* python -u fractional_cascading.py 
Each node will be named by its index in preorder traversal just for viewing's sake
The tree structure is shown in the diagram bt_fc_demo.png
